		<li><p>The <q>< link ></q> element can be used in a HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an emply element (meaning that it does not haveto have a closing tag) and it lives inside the <q>< head ></q> element.
		it should use three attributes</p></li>
		<ol>
			<li><p>"href": this specifies the path to the CSS file. (which is often places in a folder called CSS or Styles)</p></li>
			<li><p>"type": this attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be "text/css".</p></li>
			<li><p>"rel": thr specifies the relatinship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value of this should be "stylesheet" when linking to a CSS file</p></li>			
		</ol>
		<li><p>An HTML page can use more that one CSS style sheet. To do this, it could have a <q>< link ></q> element for every CSS file it uses. some users use this method to have one CSS for fonts and another for layout</p></li>
		<li><p>For example: <q>< link href = "CSS/layout" type = "text/css" rel = "stylesheet"/ ></q>
