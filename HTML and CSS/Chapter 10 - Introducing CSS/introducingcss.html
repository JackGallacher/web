		<li><p>The <q>< link ></q> element can be used in a HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an emply element (meaning that it does not haveto have a closing tag) and it lives inside the <q>< head ></q> element.
		it should use three attributes</p></li>
		<ol>
			<li><p>"href": this specifies the path to the CSS file. (which is often places in a folder called CSS or Styles)</p></li>
			<li><p>"type": this attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be "text/css".</p></li>
			<li><p>"rel": thr specifies the relatinship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value of this should be "stylesheet" when linking to a CSS file</p></li>			
		</ol>
		<li><p>An HTML page can use more that one CSS style sheet. To do this, it could have a <q>< link ></q> element for every CSS file it uses. some users use this method to have one CSS for fonts and another for layout</p></li>
		<li><p>For example: <q>< link href = "CSS/layout" type = "text/css" rel = "stylesheet"/ ></q>

		<li><p>You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <q>< style ></q> element, which usually sits within the <q>< head ></q> element of the page.</p></li>
		<li><p>The style attribute should use the "type" attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS. The value should be "text/css". e.g. <q>< style type = "text/css" > CSS CODE HERE < / style ></q></p></li>

		<ul>
			<li><p>There are many different types of CSS selectors that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.The table below introduces the most commonly used CSS selectors</p></li>

	<h2 id = "CSSCascade" class = "headings">How CSS rules cascade</h2>
	<ul id = "cascadelist">
		<li id = "specific"><p>If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, it is important to understand which will take precedence.</p></li>
		<li><p>If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence.</p></li>
		<li><p>If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will take precedence over more general ones. for example, h1{} is more specific than *{}, p b{} is more specific than p, and p#inro is more specific than p
		<li><p>You can add "!important" after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than the other rules</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id = inheritance>Inheritance</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>If you specify the font-family or color properties on the <q>< body ></q> element, they will apply to most of the child elements. This is because the value of the font-family property is <b>inherited</b> by child elements.</p></li>
		<li><p>You can force a lot of properties to inherit values from thier parent elements by using "inherit" for the value of the properties. e.g. "padding: inherit". for example, "background-color" and "border" properties are not inherited by a child class as the page would lokk messy if it it. 
		but if you wanted them to, you would add "background-colour: inherit" to force it to be the same as its parent.</li></p>
