		<h2>Controlling the sizes of images in CSS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You can control the size of an image using the <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.</li>
			<li>A method of keeping uniform images across a website is to give images class names such as "small", "medium" and "large"</li>
			<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "large"/>
			<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "medium"/>
			<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "small"/>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Aligning images using CSS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Just as you can use it with text, you can use the <b>float</b> element to move an image to the left or right  of its containing block allowing text to flow around it.</li>
			<li>A common way of applying floats to elements is to create a new class which floats them in a specific way such as "align-left" and "align-right"</li>
			<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "small align-left"/>
			<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "small align-left"/>
		</ul>

		<h2>Centering images using CSS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a block-level element using the <b>display</b> property with a value of <b>block</b> (display: block;)</li>
			<li>Once it has been made into a block lelvel element, there are two common ways you can centre an image:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>On the containing element, you can use <b>text-align: centre;</b></li>
				<li>On the image itself, you can use <b>margin: 0px auto</b></li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
		<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "small center-image"/>
		
		<h2>Background Images</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The <b>background-image: url("mybackground.gif")</b> allows you place an image behind any html element. By default, the image will repeat to fill the entire box.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Repeating Images</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The <b>background-repeat</b> property can have four values:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>background-repeat: repeat; The background image is repeated horizonatally and vertically. (the default method if background-repeat is not used.)</li>
				<li>background-repeat: repeat-x; The image is repeated horizontally.</li>
				<li>background-repeat: repeat-y; The image is repeated vertically.</li>
				<li>background-repeat: no-repeat; This image is shown only once.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>The <b>background-attachment</b> specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. It can have one of two values:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>background-attachment: fixed; The background image stay in the same position on the page</li>
				<li>background-attachment: scroll; The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
