		<h2>Controlling the sizes of images in CSS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You can control the size of an image using the <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.</li>
			<li>A method of keeping uniform images across a website is to give images class names such as "small", "medium" and "large"</li>
			<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "large"/>
			<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "medium"/>
			<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "small"/>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Aligning images using CSS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Just as you can use it with text, you can use the <b>float</b> element to move an image to the left or right  of its containing block allowing text to flow around it.</li>
			<li>A common way of applying floats to elements is to create a new class which floats them in a specific way such as "align-left" and "align-right"</li>
			<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "small align-left"/>
			<img src = "Images/Nyan.png" class = "small align-left"/>
		</ul>
