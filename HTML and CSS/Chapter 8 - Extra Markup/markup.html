			<li><p>Becuase there have been several versions of html, each webpage should begin with a "DOCTYPE" declaration to a tell a broser which type of html the page is using e.g. <q>< !DOCTYPE html ></q></p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id = "Comments">Comments</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>If you want to add comments to your code that will not be visible in the users browsers, you can add the text between these characters: <q> < !-- comments go here -- > </q></p></li>

		<h2 id = "ID Attribute">ID Attribute</h2>
		<ul>

		</ul>
		
		<h2 id = "Class Attribute">Class Attribute</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Every HTML element can also have a "class" attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements on the page. e.g. <q>< p class = "important info" > important paragraph stuff < / p></q></p></li>
			<li><p>This also helps you add CSS to all class members giving them the same look without having to alter each one individually.</p></li>

		<div id = "Chapter List">
			<ul>
				<li><p>The <q>< div ></q> element allows you to group a set of element together in one block level box.</p></li>
				<li><p>For example, you might create a "div" element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (the logo and the navigation), or you might create a "div" element to contain comments from visitors.</p></li>
				<li><p>Adding an "id" tag to the div element allows you to modify a specific div section using css</p></li>
				<li><p>To use the div tag, put your code between an opening <q>< div id = "example"</q> and closing <q>< / div ></q> tags.</p></li>

						<li><p>2: Contains a number of inline elements</p></li>

			<li><p>An iframe is created by using the <q>< iframe ></q> element. There are a few attributes that you will need to know to use it:</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>"src" The src attribute specifies the url of the page you want to show. e.g. <q>< iframe src = "http//:www.bbc.co.uk" >< / iframe ></q></li></p>
					<li><p>"height" and "width" are used to determine the size of the iframe. e.g. <q>< iframe src = "http//:www.bbc.co.uk" height = "350" width = "450">< / iframe ></q></li></p>
					<li><p>In HTML5, a new attribute called "seamless" can be applied where scrollbars (depreciated, used in HTML4) are not desired, using seamless doesnt require a vlue but can be given the value of "seamless". e.g. <q>< iframe src = "http//:www.bbc.co.uk" height = "350" width = "450" seamless = "seamless">< / iframe ></q></li></p>

			<li><p>Some defined values for this attribute that are commonly used are: "description", "keywords" and "robots". robots indicates if search engines should see this page, a values of "noindex" can be used if this page should not be added. A value of "nofollow" can be used if search
			engines should add this page but not any pages that it links to</p></li>
			<li><p>The meta element also uses the "http-equiv" and "content" attribute in pairs. examples of "http-equiv" include "pragma" which prevents the browser from cacheing the page and "expires" which indicates when a page should expire.</p></li>
