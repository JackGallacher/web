	<h1>Boxes</h1>
	<h2>Box Dimensions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>By default, a box is sized just big enough to hold it contents. To set your own dimensions for a box, you can use the "height:" and "width:" properties</p></li> 
		<li><p>The most popular way to specify box size is in pixels, percentages or ems. When using percentages, the box size is relative to the size of the browser window. Or if it already inside a box, it is relative to the size of that box. 
				With ems, the box is based on the size of the text within it</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<div class = "Dimensions">
		<p class = "Dimensions">Here is an example of how boxes can be edited, these two boxes have been given a different colour and have been resized using "height:" and "width:"</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Limiting Width</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the users screen. In such designs, the "min-width:" property specifies the smallest size a box can be when it is displayed when the prowser windows is narrow, and the "max-width:" property
				indicates the maximum width a box can be when the browser window is wide</p></li>
		
		<li><p>These are very helpful properties tho ensure that the contents of pages are legible (especially on the smaller screens of handlheld devices). For example, you can use the "max-width:" property to ensure that lines of text do not appear too widewithin a big browser
				window and you can use the "min-width:" propert to make sure they don't appear too narrow.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<table>	
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th scope = "col">Table Column</th>
				<th scope = "col">Another Column</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th scope = "row" >Table Row</th>
				<td class = "RandomParagraph">This is an example paragraph to show how the "min-width:" and "max-width:" work in a table: A sphere collapses beneath the annual youth. Below a diet detector pulses the compound workload. 
					Before a stale directory prosecutes the irritating employer. The concentrate wets the shorthand head. When can the nominate catalog suspect?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th scope = "row">Another Row</th>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<h2>Limiting Height</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>In the same way that you might want to limit the width of an box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is acheived using the "min-height" and "max-height" properties.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Overflowing Content</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The "overflow:" property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:</p></li>
		<ol>
			<li><p>overflow: hidden; - This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box</p></li>
			<li><p>overflow: scroll; - This property adds a scrollbar so the users can scroll to see the missing content.</p></li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<p class = "Hidden">Whatever well sacks the basic risk with the spectacular. Any innocence escapes against a performing timer. Another sorted process sneaks on top of a plastic. Before the norm despairs a skeleton. A confident agenda asks a scarce rumor.</p>
	<p class = "Scroll">The creature hangs from a bloody bathroom. Should the disregard parrot its men's tiger? The devil advertises? How does the target crack? A disguise comprehends the helpless force.</p>
