	<h1>Boxes</h1>
	<h2>Box Dimensions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>By default, a box is sized just big enough to hold it contents. To set your own dimensions for a box, you can use the "height:" and "width:" properties</p></li> 
		<li><p>The most popular way to specify box size is in pixels, percentages or ems. When using percentages, the box size is relative to the size of the browser window. Or if it already inside a box, it is relative to the size of that box. 
				With ems, the box is based on the size of the text within it</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<div class = "Dimensions">
		<p class = "Dimensions">Here is an example of how boxes can be edited, these two boxes have been given a different colour and have been resized using "height:" and "width:"</p>
