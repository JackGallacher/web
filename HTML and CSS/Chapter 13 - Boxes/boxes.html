	<h1>Boxes</h1>
	<h2>Box Dimensions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>By default, a box is sized just big enough to hold it contents. To set your own dimensions for a box, you can use the "height:" and "width:" properties</p></li> 
		<li><p>The most popular way to specify box size is in pixels, percentages or ems. When using percentages, the box size is relative to the size of the browser window. Or if it already inside a box, it is relative to the size of that box. 
				With ems, the box is based on the size of the text within it</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<div class = "Dimensions">
		<p class = "Dimensions">Here is an example of how boxes can be edited, these two boxes have been given a different colour and have been resized using "height:" and "width:"</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Limiting Width</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the users screen. In such designs, the "min-width:" property specifies the smallest size a box can be when it is displayed when the prowser windows is narrow, and the "max-width:" property
				indicates the maximum width a box can be when the browser window is wide</p></li>
		
		<li><p>These are very helpful properties tho ensure that the contents of pages are legible (especially on the smaller screens of handlheld devices). For example, you can use the "max-width:" property to ensure that lines of text do not appear too widewithin a big browser
				window and you can use the "min-width:" propert to make sure they don't appear too narrow.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Limiting Height</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>In the same way that you might want to limit the width of an box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is acheived using the "min-height" and "max-height" properties.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Overflowing Content</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The "overflow:" property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:</p></li>
		<ol>
			<li><p>overflow: hidden; - This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box</p></li>
			<li><p>overflow: scroll; - This property adds a scrollbar so the users can scroll to see the missing content.</p></li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<p class = "Hidden">Whatever well sacks the basic risk with the spectacular. Any innocence escapes against a performing timer. Another sorted process sneaks on top of a plastic. Before the norm despairs a skeleton. A confident agenda asks a scarce rumor.</p>
	<p class = "Scroll">The creature hangs from a bloody bathroom. Should the disregard parrot its men's tiger? The devil advertises? How does the target crack? A disguise comprehends the helpless force.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<h2>Border Width</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The "border-width:" property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels or on of three values: "thick", "thin", or "medium". You cannot use percantages with this property</p></li>
		<li><p>You can control the individual size of borders using four seperate properties:</p></li>
		<ol>
			<li><p>border-top-width:</p></li>
			<li><p>border-right-width</p></li>
			<li><p>border-left-width</p></li>
			<li><p>border-bottom-width</p></li>
		</ol>
		<li><p>You can also specify different widths for the four border values in one property like so: "border-width: 4px 6px 4px 3px;"</p></li>
		<li><p>The values appear in clockwise order; top, right, bottom, left</p></li>		
	</ul>
	<h2>Border Style</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>You can control the style of a border using the "border-style" property. This property can take the following values:</p></li>
		<ol>
			<li><p>border-style: solid; - A single solid line.</p></li>
			<li><p>border-style: dotted; - A series of squared dots (If your border is 2px wide, then the dots are 2px squared with a 2px gap between each dot)</p></li>
			<li><p>border-style: dashed; - A series of short lines.</p></li>
			<li><p>border-style: double; - Two solid lines (the value of the "border-width" property creates the sum of the two lines)</p></li>
			<li><p>border-style: groove; - Appears to be carved into the page.</p></li>
			<li><p>border-style: ridge; - Appears to stick out from the page.</p></li>
			<li><p>border-style: inset; - Appears embedded into the page.</p></li>
			<li><p>border-style: outset; - looks like it is coming out of the screen</p></li>			
			<li><p>border-style: none; - No border is shown</p></li>
		</ol>
		<li><p>You can individually change the styles of different borders using, "border-top-style", "border-right-style", "border-bottom-style", and "border-left-style"</p></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Border Color</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>You can specify the color of a border using either RGB colors, Hexcodes or CSS color names. e.g. border-color: red;</p></li>
		<li><p>It is possible to individually control the colors of the borders on different sides of the borders using "border-top-color", "border-right-color", "border-bottom-color", and "border-left-color"
		<li><p>It is alos possible to use a shorthand to control all four border colors in one propery. e.g.: "border-color: blue red green orange;" with the values appearing in a clockwise order.</p></li>
	</ul>

	How will the prophet pinch a stirring appeal? The realized hydrogen exits underneath another image.</p>
	
	<h2>Shorthand</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The "border:" property allows you to specify the width, style and color of a border in one property (and the values should be coded in that specific order) e.g. 
	</ul>
	<p id = "Shorthand">An incident damage crowns a simple gas. Will the brass recover? A charge encodes the conservative. How will the gown compromise our conductor?</p>
	
	<h2>Padding</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The "padding:" property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.</p></li>
		<li><p>The value of this property is mostly specified in pixels, however if it is done in percentage, it is a percentage of its containing box. e.g. padding: 12px;</p></li>
		<li><p>You can specify different padding for each side of th box using: "padding-top:", "padding-right:", "padding-left:", "padding-bottom"</p></li>
		<li><p>Or, you can use shorthand to specify padding for each of the sides clockwise. e.g. padding: 12px, 3px, 5px, 12px;</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p id = "Padding">Should the enthusiasm scroll the obsolete torture? A fur breathes before a solicitor. Throughout a mathematician thinks a stone doctrine.The capable photocopy stretches under the hexadecimal result.

	<h2>Margin</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The "margin:" property control the gap between boxes. It's value is commoly given in pixels, although you may use percentages or ems.</p></li>
		<li><p>If the width of a box is psecified then the margin is added to the width of the box.</p></li>
		<li><p>You can specify values for each side of the box using; "margin-top:", "margin-right:", "margin-bottom:" and "margin-left:"</p></li>
		<li><p>You can also use shorthand to set a different margin for each side (in a clockwise order) e.g. "margin: 1px 4px 6px 7px;"</p></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Centering Content</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>If you want to center a box on the page (or inside th element it sits in,) You can set the "left-margin" and "right-margin" to "auto"</p></li>
		<li><p>In order to denter a box, you need to set a "width" for the box otherwise it will take up the full size of the page</p></li>
		<li><p>Once you have set the width of the box, setting the left and right margin to "auto" will make the browser put an equal gap on each side of the box, centering it</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p class = "margin" id = "centerbox">Should the enthusiasm scroll the obsolete torture? A fur breathes before a solicitor. Throughout a mathematician thinks a stone doctrine.The capable photocopy stretches under the hexadecimal result.

	<h2>Change Inline/Block</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The "display" property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page</p></li>
		<li><p>The value these properties can take are:</p></li>
		<ol>
			<li><p>display: inline; - This causes a black-level element to act like an inline element</p></li>
			<li><p>display: block; - This causes an inline element  to act like a black level element</p></li>
			<li><p>display: inline-block; - This causes a block-level element to flow like an inline element, while retaining other features of a block like element.</p></li>
			<li><p>display: none; - This hides an element from a page.
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<ul id = "display">
		<li>Home</li>
		<li>Products</li>
		<li class = "coming-soon">Services</li>
		<li>About</li>
		<li>Contact</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Hiding Boxes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The "visibility" property allows you to hid boxes from users but it leaves a space where  the element would have been.</p></li>
		<li><p>This property can take two values</p></li>
		<ol>
			<li><p>visibility: hidden; - This hides the element.</p></li>
			<li><p>visibility: visible; - This shows the element</p></li>
		</ol>
		<li><p>If you do not want a blank space to appear, then you should use the "display" property with a value of "none" (display: none;) instead.</p></li>
