	<h1>Layout</h1>
	<h2>Normal Flow</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSSproperty to indicate the elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be: <q>position: static;</q></p></li>
		<li><p>I have not specified a <b>width:</b> property for the heading element, so you can see how it streatches the width of the entire browser window by default.</p></li>
		<li><p>The paragraphs have been restricted to 450 pixels wide. This shows how the elements in normal flow start on a new line even if they do not take up the full width of the browser window.</p></li>
