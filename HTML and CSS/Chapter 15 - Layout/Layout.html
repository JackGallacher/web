	<h1>Layout</h1>
	<h2>Normal Flow - position: static;</h2>
	<ul id = "Set_Paragraph_Width">
		<li><p>In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSSproperty to indicate the elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be: <q>position: static;</q></p></li>
		<li><p>I have not specified a <b>width:</b> property for the heading element, so you can see how it streatches the width of the entire browser window by default.</p></li>
		<li><p>The paragraphs have been restricted to 450 pixels wide. This shows how the elements in normal flow start on a new line even if they do not take up the full width of the browser window.</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Relative Positioning - position: relative;</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.</p></li>
		<li><p>For example, ypu can move it 10 pixels lower than it would have been in normal flow or 20% to the right.</p></li>
		<li><p>You can indicate that an element should be relativly positioned by using <q>position: relative;</q>		
		<li><p>You can then use the offset properties (top and bottom and left or right) to indicate how far to move the element from where it would have been in normal flow.</p></li>
		<ul id = "Relative_Move">
			<li><p>To move the box up or down, you can use either the <q>top</q> or <q>bottom</q> properties.</p></li>
			<li><p>To move the box horizonatally, you can use either the <q>left</q> or <q>right</q> properties.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id = "Absolute_Move">Absolute Positioning - position: absolute;</h2>
	<ul id = "Set_Paragraph_Width">
		<li><p>When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page. (They act like its not there.)</p></li>
		<li><p>The box offset properties (top, bottom, left, right) specify where the element should appear in relation to containing element.</p></li>
		<li><p>In this example, the heading has been positioned 500 pixels from its left edge. The width of the heading is set to be 250 pixels wide.</p></li>
		<li><p>The width property has also been applied to the <q>< p ></q> elements in this example to provent the text from overlapping and becoming unreadable.</p></li>			
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id = "Set_Fixed_Position">Fixed Positioning - position: fixed;</h2>
	<ul id = "Add_Margin">
		<li><p>Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning the requires the position property to have a value of fixed.</p></li>
		<li><p>It positions the element in relation to the browser. Therefore, when a user scrolls down a page, it stays in the exact same place.</p></li>
		<li><p>To control where the fixed position box appears in relation to the browser window, the box offset properties arw used (top, bottom, left, right)</p></li>
		<li><p>The <q>< p ></q> elements are in normal flow and ignore the space the the heading element would have taken up. Therefore, the <q>margin: top;</q> has been used to push the first <q>< p ></q> element below where the fixed heading is sitting.</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id = "Set_Z">Overlapping Elements - z-index</h2>
	<ul id = "Overlap_Relative">
		<li><p>When you use relative, absolute or fixed positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top those that are earlier in the page.</p></li>
		<li><p>If you want to control which element sits on top, you can use the <q>z-index</q> property. its vaue is a number, and the higher the number, the closer that element is to the front. For example, an element with a <q>z-index</q> of 10 will appear over the top of on with a <q>z-index</q> of 5</p></li>
		<li><p>In this example, we use <q>position: relative;</q> for the paragraphs. Becuase the paragraphs are relativly positioned, by default they would appear over the top of the heading as the user scrolls down the page.
			To ensure the <q>< h2 ></q> element stays on top, we use the <q>z-index</q> property on the rule for the <q>< h2 ></q> element</p></li>
		<li><p>The <q>z-index</q> is sometimes reffered to as <b>stacking content</b> (As if the block have been stacked on top of each other and the z-axis). It is the equivilant of using the 'bring to front' and 'send to back' features.</p></li>		
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	
	<h2 id = "Float_Heading">Floating Elements - float</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The <q>float</q> property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.</p></li>
		<li><p>Anything else that sits inside the containing element will flow around the element that is floated.</p></li>
		<li><p>When you use the <q>float</q> property, you should also use the <q>width</q> property to indicate how wide the floated element should be. If you do not, results can be inconsistent but the box is likley to take up the full width of the containing element (just like it would in normal flow)</p></li>
		<li><p>In this example, the <q>< h2 ></q> element is floated to the right and the paragraphs the follow the heading flow around the floated header.</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Using float to place elements side by side - float</h2>	
	<p id = "Float_Side">A lot of layouts place boxes next to each other. the <b>float</b> property is commonly used to acheive this.</p>
	<p id = "Float_Side">When elements are floated, the height of the boxes can affect where the following elements sit.</p>
	<p id = "Float_Side">In this example, each of these paragraphs has a <b>float</b> and a <b>width</b> property set.</p>	
	
	<br/>

	<br/>
	
	<h2>Clearing Floats - clear</h2>
	<p id = "Float_Clear">The <b>clear</b> property allow you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or right hand side of a box. It can take the following values:</p>
	<p id = "Float_Clear">clear: left; - The left hand side of the box should not touch any other elements appearing in the same containing element.</p> 
	<p id = "Float_Clear">clear: right; - The right hand side of the box should not touch any other elements appearing in the same containing element.</p>
	<p id = "Float_Clear">clear: both; - Neither the left not the right hand side of the boxes will touch elements appearing in the same containing element.</p>
	<p id = "Float_Clear">clear: none; - Elements can touch eother side.</p>
