			<li><p>The  most popular way of adding Flash into a web page is using JavaScript. There are several scripts that allow you to do this without and in depth understanding of the JavaScript language</p></li>
			<li><p>The script used to display this flash animation is called SWFObject. You can obtain a copy if ti for free from Google and you can see how it is used in this pages source code.</p></li>
			<li><p>One advantage to using this technique is that it allows browsers to shiw alternative content for users whose browsers are not capable of showing flash.</p></li>
			<li><p>This technique uses a <q>< div ></q> element to create a space where the Flash movie should sit. The <q>< div ></q> element has an "id" attribute whole value is used by the SWFObject script. In this example, the
			value of the id attribute is "bird"</p></li>
