		<h1 id = "Title">Forms...</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><p>A form is placed within the <q>< form ></q> tag</p></li>
			<li><p>Every form element needs an "action" attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that is receiving the form data. e.g. <q>< form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php"></q></p></li>
			<li><p>Forms can be sent using two methods, "get" or "post".</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>With the "get" method, values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the "action" attribute. this is ideal for short forms and when you are just retreiving data from a web server.</p></li>
					<li><p>With the "post" method, values are sent in HTTP headers. You should use these when your form is; uploading a file, is very log, contains sensitive data or adds stuff to a database.</p></li>
					<li><p>If no method is used, it will atomatically be set as the "get method"</p></li>
					<li><p>e.g. <q>< form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php" method = "get" > example below...</q></p></li>
					<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php" method = "get">
						<p>This is where the form data will go, doesnt really show it as a form... but look at the code!</p>
					</form>
				</ul>			
		</ul>
		<hr /><!--this draws a line across the page.-->
		
		<h2 id = "Input">The Input tag</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The <q>< input ></q> tag is used to create several different form controls. the value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating</p></li>
			<li><p>The <q>< type ></q> attribute is used in the input tag to define what type of input will be eneted by the user. for example <q>< input type = "text" ></q></p></li>			
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id = "Text Input">Text Input</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Text input is created by using the "text" input type. e.g.<q>< input type = "text" ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>A "name" attribute must be given to each form so the server knows which forms control each peice of data was entered into. e.g. <q>< input type = "text"  name = "username"></q></p></li>
			<li><p>The "size" attribute indicates the character width of the input box. although nowadays, this should be done with CSS. e.g.<q>< input type = "text"  name = "username" size = "15"></q></p></li>
			<li><p>The "maxlength" attribute is used to limit the amount of character that can be typed into the input box. e.g.<q>< input type = "text"  name = "username" size = "15" maxlength - "5"></q></p></li>			
		</ul>
		<p>for example... <q>< input type = "text" name = "username" size = "15" maxlength = "5" / ></q> placed within the form tags with a paragrap saying "Username" looks like.</p>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<p>
				Username:
				<input type = "text" name = "username" size = "15" maxlength = "5" />
			</p>
		</form>
		<h2 id = "Password Input">Password Input</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Password input it layed out exactly like the text input, the only thing that changes is the "type" attribute. For passwords this needs to be changed to "password" instead of "text". e.g. <q>< input type = "password" name = "password" size = "15" maxlength = "5"/></q></p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Example using both the username (from above) and the new password text box</p>
			<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
				<p>
					Username:
					<input type = "text" name = "username" size = "15" maxlength = "5"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					Password:
					<input type = "password" name = "username" size = "15" maxlength = "5"/>
				</p>			
			</form>

		<h2 id = "Text Area">Text Area</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The <q>< textarea ></q> element is used to create multi-line text input. Unlike other input elements, this is not an empty element. it should have an opening and closing tag.</p></li>
			<li><p>Any text between the <q>< textarea ></q> and <q>< / textarea ></q> tags will appear in the text box when the page is loaded.</p></li>
			<li><p>The "cols" and "rows" attributes should not really be used, the size of the text box should be controlled by CSS<li><p>
			<li><p>As usual, a textarea tag goes within a forms tag.</p></li>			
		</ul>
		<p>Example of a text area below.</p>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<p>What did you think of the gig?</p>
			<textarea rows = "5" cols = "15">Input answer here...</textarea>
		</form>
		
		<h2 id = "Radio Buttons">Radio Buttons</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Radio buttons are crated inside the input tags and given the type of "radio". e.g. <q>< input type = "radio" / ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>Radio buttons should be given a "name" attribute and "value" attribute. The "name" attribute is sent to the server and links to the specific radio buttons so data can be used. The "value" is the data value that is sent to the server.
					for example: <q>< input type = radio name = "genre" value = "jazz" / ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>You can also add a "checked" attribute to one radio button in your set which will load it checked. e.g. <q>< input type = radio name = "genre" value = "jazz" checked = "checked"/ ></q>		
		</ul>
		<p>Example of radio buttons...</p>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<p>
				Please select your favorate genre of music:
				<br />
				
				<input type = "radio" name = "genre" title = "Jazz" checked = "checked"/>Jazz<!--not how these are still in a paragraph tag. this lets us add text/names before the radio buttons.-->
				<input type = "radio" name = "genre" title = "Rock"/>Rock
				<input type = "radio" name = "genre" title = "Pop"/>Pop
