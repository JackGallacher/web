		<h1 id = "Title">Forms...</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><p>A form is placed within the <q>< form ></q> tag</p></li>
			<li><p>Every form element needs an "action" attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that is receiving the form data. e.g. <q>< form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php"></q></p></li>
			<li><p>Forms can be sent using two methods, "get" or "post".</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>With the "get" method, values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the "action" attribute. this is ideal for short forms and when you are just retreiving data from a web server.</p></li>
					<li><p>With the "post" method, values are sent in HTTP headers. You should use these when your form is; uploading a file, is very log, contains sensitive data or adds stuff to a database.</p></li>
					<li><p>If no method is used, it will atomatically be set as the "get method"</p></li>
					<li><p>e.g. <q>< form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php" method = "get" > example below...</q></p></li>
					<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php" method = "get">
						<p>This is where the form data will go, doesnt really show it as a form... but look at the code!</p>
					</form>
				</ul>			
		</ul>
		<hr /><!--this draws a line across the page.-->
		
		<h2 id = "Input">The Input tag</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The <q>< input ></q> tag is used to create several different form controls. the value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating</p></li>
			<li><p>The <q>< type ></q> attribute is used in the input tag to define what type of input will be eneted by the user. for example <q>< input type = "text" ></q></p></li>			
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id = "Text Input">Text Input</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Text input is created by using the "text" input type. e.g.<q>< input type = "text" ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>A "name" attribute must be given to each form so the server knows which forms control each peice of data was entered into. e.g. <q>< input type = "text"  name = "username"/ ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>The "size" attribute indicates the character width of the input box. although nowadays, this should be done with CSS. e.g.<q>< input type = "text"  name = "username" size = "15"/ ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>The "maxlength" attribute is used to limit the amount of character that can be typed into the input box. e.g.<q>< input type = "text"  name = "username" size = "15" maxlength - "5"/ ></q></p></li>			
		</ul>
		<p>for example... <q>< input type = "text" name = "username" size = "15" maxlength = "5" / ></q> placed within the form tags with a paragrap saying "Username" looks like.</p>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<p>
				Username:
				<input type = "text" name = "username" size = "15" maxlength = "5" />
			</p>
		</form>
		<h2 id = "Password Input">Password Input</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Password input it layed out exactly like the text input, the only thing that changes is the "type" attribute. For passwords this needs to be changed to "password" instead of "text". e.g. <q>< input type = "password" name = "password" size = "15" maxlength = "5"/></q></p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Example using both the username (from above) and the new password text box</p>
			<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
				<p>
					Username:
					<input type = "text" name = "username" size = "15" maxlength = "5"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					Password:
					<input type = "password" name = "username" size = "15" maxlength = "5"/>
				</p>			
			</form>

		<h2 id = "Text Area">Text Area</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The <q>< textarea ></q> element is used to create multi-line text input. Unlike other input elements, this is not an empty element. it should have an opening and closing tag.</p></li>
			<li><p>Any text between the <q>< textarea ></q> and <q>< / textarea ></q> tags will appear in the text box when the page is loaded.</p></li>
			<li><p>The "cols" and "rows" attributes should not really be used, the size of the text box should be controlled by CSS</li><p>
			<li><p>As usual, a textarea tag goes within a forms tag.</p></li>			
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<p>What did you think of the gig?</p>
			<textarea rows = "5" cols = "15">Input answer here...</textarea>
		</form>
		
		<h2 id = "Radio Buttons">Radio Buttons</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Radio buttons are crated inside the input tags and given the type of "radio". e.g. <q>< input type = "radio" / ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>Radio buttons should be given a "name" attribute and "value" attribute. The "name" attribute is sent to the server and links to the specific radio buttons so data can be used. The "value" is the data value that is sent to the server.
					for example: <q>< input type = radio name = "genre" value = "jazz" / ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>You can also add a "checked" attribute to one radio button in your set which will load it checked. e.g. <q>< input type = radio name = "genre" value = "jazz" checked = "checked"/ ></q>		
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<p>
				Please select your favorate genre of music:
				<br />
				
				<input type = "radio" name = "genre" title = "Jazz" checked = "checked"/>Jazz<!--note how these are still in a paragraph tag. this lets us add text/names before the radio buttons.-->
				<input type = "radio" name = "genre" title = "Rock"/>Rock
				<input type = "radio" name = "genre" title = "Pop"/>Pop				
			</p>		
		</form>
		
		<h2 id = "Checkbox">Checkbox</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>A checkbox is made the same way as a radio button, the only thing that changes is the "type" attribute. It changes to "checkbox". e.g. <q>< input type = "checkbox" name = "genre" title = "Jazz" / > </q></p></li>
			<li><p>With a checkbox, you can select multiple options, you can still select a box to be check too by using the checked = "checked" attribute</p></li>
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<p>
				Which is your favorate music streaming service?
				<input type = "checkbox" name = "service" title = "Spotify" checked = "checked"/>Spotify
				<input type = "checkbox" name = "service" title = "Last.fm"/>Last.fm
				<input type = "checkbox" name = "service" title = "iTunes"/>iTunes			
			</p>		
		</form>
				
		<h2 id = "Selection Box">Selection Box (Drop Down)...</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>A select box (aka drop down) allows on option to be selected from a drop down list. The <q>< select ></q> element is used to create this drop down box. it contains two or more <q>< option ></q> elements</p></li>
			<li><p>Within the <q>< select ></q> element the attribute "name" must be given. This indicates the name of the form control being sent to the server, along with the value the user submitted. e.g. <q>< select name = "devices"></p></li>
			<li><p>The <q>< option ></q> element is used to specify the options that the user can select from. The words between the opening "option" tag and closing "option tags will be shown the user drop down."e.g. <q>< select name = "devices">< option > iPod < / option >< / select ></q></p>
			<li><p>The option element uses the "value" attribute to indicate the value that is sent to the server along with the name of the control if this option is selected. e.g. <q>< select name = "devices">< option value = "iPod"> iPod < / option >< / select ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>The "selected" attribute can be used to indicate the option that should be selected when the page loads using selected = "selected" e.g. <q>< select name = "devices">< option value = "iPod" selected = "selected"> iPod < / option >< / select ></q></p></li>		
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<p>Please select your favorate device:</p>
			<select name = "devices"><!--Only <option> tags can go between the <select> tags.-->
				<option value = "iPod" selected = "selected">iPod</option>

				<option value = "Minidisk">Minidisk</option>			
			</select>
		</form>
		
		<h2 id = "Multiple Select Box">Multiple Select Box...</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You can turn a drop down select box into a box that shows more than one option by adding the "size" attribute within the "select" element. Its value should be the number of options you want to show at once. e.g. <q>< select name = "devices" size = 3></q></p></li>
			<li><p>You can allows users to select multiple options from this list by adding the "multiple" attribute with a value of "multiple" e.g. <q>< select name = "devices" size = "3" multiple = "multiple" ></q></p> to select multiple after this, the control key must be help when selecting options</li>
		</ul>

			</select>			
		</form>
		
		<h2 id = "File Input Box">File Input Box...</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>If you want to allow users to upload a file, you will need to use a file input box.</p></li>
			<li><p>To do this, add type = "file" into the "input" element. This type of input creates a box that looks like a text input followed by a browse button. e.g. <q>< input type = "file" name = "user_file"/ ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>When you are allowing users to upload files, the method attribute on the "form" element must have a value of "post". e.g. <q>< form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php" method = "post" ></q>
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php" method = "post">
			<p>Upload your file below.</p>
			<input type = "file" name = "user_file"/><br />
			<input type = "submit" value = "upload"/><!--This submits the contents of the form it is in to the "action" location in the form attribute.--->
		</form>
		
		<h2 id = "Submit button">Submit Button...</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>To send data of your form to the server, add the type "submit" into a new input element inside your form with the "value" attribute determining the words shown on the button. You can add a "name" attribute but it is not needed. e.g.
			<q>< input type = "submit" name = "upload" value = "upload" ></q></p></li>
		</ul>
				
		<h2 id = "Image Button">Image Button...</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>If you want to use an image for the submit button you can give it the type attribute with a value of "image". e.g. <q>< input type = "image" /></q></p></li>
			<li><p>To upload the image to the button, you use "src", "width", "height" and "alt" attributes. they work exactly the same as the do when using and "< image >" tag. e.g. <q>< input type = "image" src = "website/images/myimage.jpg" width = "10" height = "15" />
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<p>Here is a submit button of my dog teddy</p>
			<input type = "image" src = "images/teddy.jpg" height = "100" width = "100"/>
		</form>

		<h2 id = "Button and Hidden Controls">Button and Hidden Controls...</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The <q>< button ></q> element allows you to combine text and images on a button by putting these attributes between the button tag. e.g. <q><  button >< image src = "images/teddy.jpg" height = "25" width = "25">Teddy!< / button ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>The type = "hidden" attribute used within input elements allows authors to add values to froms that the users cant see. e.g. <q>< input type = "hidden" name = "bookmark" / ></p></li>
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
		<form>
			<button><image src = "images/teddy.jpg" height = "25" width = "25"/>Teddy!</button>
			<input type = "hidden" name = "teddybutton" value = "teddy"/>
		</form>
		
		<h2 id = "Labelling From Controls">Labelling Form Controls</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Each form control should have its own <q>< label ></q> element as this makes it accesible to vision impaired users.</p></li>
			<li>
				<p>The <q>< label ></q> element can be used in two ways, it can:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Wrap around both text description and the form input. e.g. <q>< label >Age: < input type = "text" name = "age" / >< label ></q></p></li>
					<li><p>Be kept seperate from the form control and use the "for" attribute to indicate which form control it is a label for. e.g. 
						<br /><q>< input id = "female" type = "radio" name = "gender" / ></q><br />
						<q>< label for = "female">Female< / label ></q>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>The "for" attribute states which form control the label belongs to. Note how the radio button above uses the "id" attribute. The value of the "id" attribute uniquely identifies an element from all other elements on a page.</p></li> 
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php" method = "post"><!--remember, use method = "post" if data is being sent to the server.-->
			<label for = "Age">Age</label><!--It displays the code from left to right, if this was put below the input, it would show on its right hand side.-->
			<input id = "Age" type = "input" name = "age">
			
			<input id = "female" type = "radio" name = "gender" value = "f">

		<h2 id = "Grouping Form Elements">Grouping Form Elements</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You can group related for controls together inside the <q>< fieldset ></q> element. This is particularly helpful for longer forms.</p></li>
			<li><p>Most browsers will show the fieldset with a line around the edge to show how they are related. The appearance can be changed in CSS</p></li>
			<li><p>The <q>< legend ></q> element can come directly after the opening <q>< fieldset ></q> tag and contains a caption which helps identify the purpose of that group of form controls</p></li>

		<h2 id = "HTML5 Form Validation">HTML5: Form Validation</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You have probabaly seen forms on the internet that give users messages if the form control has not been filled in correctly. This is know as <b>form validation</b>
			<li><p>To add validation to a field, the attribute "requred " is used, with the value of "required". e.g. <q>< input id = "password" name = "password" required = "required"</q>
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php" method = "post">

		<h2 id = "HTML5: Date Input">HTML5: Date Input</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Many forms need to gather information such as dates, email addresses, and URL's. This has raditionally been done using text inputs.</p></li>
			<li><p>HTML5 introduces new form controld to standardize the way that some information is gathered. Older browsers that do not recognize these inputs will just treat them as a single line text box.</p></li>
			<li><p>If you are asking the user for a date, you can use the <q>< input ></q> element and give it a "type" attribute of date. This will create a date input in browsers that support the new HTML 5 input types.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<input type = "date" name = "date">
			<input type = "submit" value = "enter date">
		</form>
		
		<h2 id = "HTML5: Email and URL Input">HTML5: Email and URL Input</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>HTML5 has also introduced inputs that allow visitors to enter email addresses and URL's. Browsers that don't support these input boxes will just treat them as text boxes.</p></li>
			<li><p>If you ask the user fan an email, you can use the "email" input. Supported browsers will check the user has provided the correct information. e.g. <q>< input type = "email" name = "email" / ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>A "URL" input can be used when you are asking the user for a web page address. e.g. <q>< input type = "url" name = "url" / ></q></p></li>
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">			
			<label>Enter email: <input type = "email" name = "email"/></label>

		<h2 id = "HTML5: Search Input">HTML5: Search Input</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>If you want to create a single line text box for search queries, HTML5 provides a special type of input for that purpose.</p></li>
			<li><p>To create a HTML5 search box the <q>< input ></q> element should have a type attribute with the value of "search" e.g. <q>< input value = "search" name = "search" / ></q></p></li>
			<li><p>On any text input, you can also use an attribute called "placeholder" whose value is text that will be shown in the text box until the user clicks in that area. e.g. <q>< input type = "search" placeholder = "type here to search..." / ></q></p></li>
		</ul>
		<form action = "http//:www.example.com/subscribe.php">
